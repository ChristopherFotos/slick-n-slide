the width of the small squares
the height of the small squares

the width of the large square
the height of the large square


the square that's becoming active must move to the center of the active square
the squares that are not becoming active must move over by their own width + the width of the gutter

incoming element must move its own width + the gutter width + (mainImgWidth - smallImgWidth)
shifting elements must move their own width + the gutter width

if the gutter between the main img and its neighbors is different, use that gutter for allof them

CENTERING
one possible way to center it: add up all the elements' widths, all the gutters, subtract 
that figureit from the container's width, and then divide that by 2, and then that's 
the original offset.  

or just take the main element's width, subtract it from the container's width, and then 
divide that by 2, then subtract half the main element's width, and then that's the original offset. 
This is better because main will always be in center,
even with an even number of items.
